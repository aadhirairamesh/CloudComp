# 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction App

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on various input features. It's built using:

- **Flask** (backend)
- **Random Forest Classifier** (model)
- **HTML/CSS** (UI)
- **Render** (for deployment)
